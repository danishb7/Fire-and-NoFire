The Wildfire Dataset project involves applying multiple image
processing techniques to multiple datasets and comparing
the results. This study involves only the classification tasks.
The ResNet model is used for training on multiple datasets
with the same structure, optimizer, loss function, learning rate,
etc., and then test the trained model on the remaining datasets.
The idea is to analyze which dataset is the most optimal
and can generalize information across all other datasets.
